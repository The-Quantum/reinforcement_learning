# REINFORCEMENT LEARNING : MAZE PROBLEM

In machine learning, there are three methods for training a model to perform a task. This include **supervised learning**, **unsupervised Learning** and **reinforcement learning**. The supervised learning involves training a model on labeled data while unsupervised learning relises on unlabeled data and the objective consiste of extracting patterns, structures, or relationships that exits within the training data. The reinforcement learning is an approch that consist of training and agent to execute and action which consist of multiple step by rewarding at each step the desired actions of behaviors that enable acheiving the goal in a fastest way and/or punishing undesired ones that does not enable acheiving the goal goal.
